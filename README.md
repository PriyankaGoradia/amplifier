# ECE 302 Lab #2 - Transistor Amplifier

## Abstract

In this lab, we designed and prototyped an audio-band amplifier with a midband voltage gain of 11 V/V ±5% at a design frequency of 2 kHz. Additionally, we ensured that the input impedance was greater than 10 kΩ and that the minimum output voltage swing was 10VPP. 

## Objectives

The objective of the lab is to design and prototype an audio-band amplifier with specific requirements outlined in the abstract. The design is divided into three stages: Stage 1 amplifier, Stage 2 amplifier, and a final testing stage where all the stages are combined.

## Design

The design process involves selecting appropriate amplifier configurations for each stage to meet the specified requirements. Common emitter and common collector configurations are used to achieve high gain and input impedance, respectively.

## Usage

- Lab 2a: Design and prototype a common emitter amplifier.
- Lab 2b: Design and prototype a common collector amplifier.
- Lab 2c: Test the entire circuit with DC power supply rails from lab 1.

## Results

Experimental results and calculations are provided in the report, including DC bias voltages, voltage gains, and input/output impedances for each stage.
